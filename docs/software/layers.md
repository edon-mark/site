# Layers

**Layers** in the softwareâ€™s UI are draggable and editable components that you can use to design and customize your pages.

Just like in any **modern page editor**, layers provide features such as:

- Moving and resizing
- Editing properties and attributes
- Deleting
- Hierarchical organization (Parent/Child structure)

In simple terms, **layers are the building blocks of your user interface that you can freely manage and customize.**
