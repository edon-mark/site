# Pages

![](/img/pages.gif)

After creating or deleting a page, you need to **run the app bundle**.  
If the bundle is already running, it must be restarted after the create or delete operation for changes to take effect.

:::info

Deleting page files is not performed by the software; they are only removed from the page list.
If you want to completely delete the files from your device, you need to do so manually.
