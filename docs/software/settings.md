# Settings

After completing the project setup steps, the software will ask you to provide two important paths:

1. **App**  
   This is the location where the project files and structure (such as pages, layers, and props) will be stored.  
   :::note
   Note that this path can be either inside your project's `/src` folder or any other custom directory outside the project.
   :::

2. **React Project**  
   This is the root directory of your React project where the main application files and configurations reside.

3. **Typesctip**
   When TypeScript is selected, leave the files you use for the app path in (ts,tsx) format according to [ClientApp](../../docs/clientApp)

These settings allow the software to synchronize and manage the React code and structures properly.
