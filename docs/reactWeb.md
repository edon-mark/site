# React Web

In the **React Web** project, there are a few important points:

1. **Set `PATH_DIR_APP` in the .env file**  
   In your `.env` file, specify the `PATH_DIR_APP` value. This path is also used by the software as the app project location.

2. **Use `npm run webpack:app`**  
   To view changes and build the **app bundle**, you can use this command so that updates are automatically reflected in the software.
